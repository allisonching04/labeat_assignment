					Bandemonium warmed up a bone chillingly cold and miserable snowing night, Friday, Dec. 29 stepping in to play in place of Mwansa Mwansa, who had to cancel her scheduled show due to laryngitis.
				</p>
					
				<p class="inner_article">
					 I hadn’t seen Bandemonium for a while so was pleased to hear guitarist/ vocalist James Oldenburg, bassist Paul Holden,  drummer Brad Brouwer, lead vocalists Shawna Romolliwa and  Erica Hunt and keyboardist Don Ponech.
				</p>

				<p class="inner_article">
					They played an array of popular ’70s hits including country and  R and B music.
					Hunt and Romolliwa shared vocals on a cover of Jolene. Oldenburg followed that up with a beautiful version of Cat Stevens’ “Wild World” as well as a re-arranged version of “Here Comes the Sun.”
				</p>

				<p class="inner_article">
					Hunt followed that up with a funky, soulful number called “The Beat Goes On.”
					Oldenburg answered with a smooth version of “Lay Down Sally.”
 					They will be playing Casino Lethbridge, Jan. 19 and 20 if you missed them.
